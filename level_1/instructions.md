# Way Back Home - Level 1: Pinpoint Location

## The Mission
Duration: 2 min

![Header](img/01-01-header.gif)

You've identified yourself to the emergency AI and your beacon is now pulsing on the planetary map—but it's barely a flicker, lost among the static. The rescue teams scanning from orbit can see *something* at your coordinates, but they can't get a lock. The signal is too weak.

To boost your beacon to full strength, you need to **confirm your exact location**. The pod's navigation system is fried, but the crash scattered salvageable evidence across the landing site. Soil samples. Strange flora. A clear view of the alien night sky.

If you can analyze this evidence and determine which region of the planet you're in, the AI can triangulate your position and amplify the beacon signal. Then—maybe—someone will find you.

Time to put the pieces together.

### Prerequisites

⚠️ **This level requires completion of Level 0.**

Before starting, verify you have:  
- [ ] `config.json` in the project root with your participant ID and coordinates  
- [ ] Your avatar visible on the world map  
- [ ] Your beacon showing (dim) at your coordinates  

If you haven't completed Level 0, [start there first](https://codelabs.developers.google.com/way-back-home-level-0/instructions).

### What You'll Build

In this level, you'll construct a **multi-agent AI system** that analyzes crash site evidence using parallel processing:

![architecture](img/01-02-architecture.png)

<aside class="positive">
<strong>Architect's Note: Two MCP Patterns</strong>

This level teaches two critical MCP patterns:  

1. <strong>Custom MCP (Imperative Pattern)</strong>: You build your own MCP server on Cloud Run with custom tools. You write the Python code that implements each tool. Used here for geological and botanical analysis with Gemini Vision.  

2. <strong>OneMCP (Managed Pattern)</strong>: You connect to Google's pre-built MCP servers (like <code>bigquery.googleapis.com/mcp</code>). The tools already exist—you just configure the connection. Used here for star catalog queries.  

This mirrors real-world architecture decisions:
<ul>
<li><strong>Custom MCP</strong>: When you need custom AI logic, domain-specific processing, or proprietary algorithms</li>
<li><strong>OneMCP</strong>: When you need standard database access, API integrations, or Google service access</li>
</ul>
</aside>

### Learning Objectives

| Concept | What You'll Learn |
|---------|-------------------|
| **Multi-Agent Systems** | Build specialized agents with single responsibilities |
| **ParallelAgent** | Compose independent agents to run concurrently |
| **before_agent_callback** | Fetch configuration and set state before agent runs |
| **ToolContext** | Access state values in tool functions |
| **Custom MCP Servers** | Build tools with the imperative pattern (Python code on Cloud Run) |
| **OneMCP BigQuery** | Connect to Google's managed MCP for BigQuery access |
| **Multimodal AI** | Analyze images and video+audio with Gemini |
| **Agent Orchestration** | Coordinate multiple agents with a root orchestrator |
| **Cloud Deployment** | Deploy MCP server and agent to Cloud Run |
| **A2A Preparation** | Structure agents for future agent-to-agent communication |

### The Planet's Biomes

The planet surface is divided into four distinct biomes, each with unique characteristics:

![planet biome](img/01-03-planet-biome.png)

Your coordinates determine which biome you crashed in. The evidence at your crash site reflects that biome's characteristics:

| Biome | Quadrant | Geological Evidence | Botanical Evidence | Astronomical Evidence |
|-------|----------|--------------------|--------------------|----------------------|
| 🧊 **CRYO** | NW (x<50, y≥50) | Frozen methane, ice crystals | Frost ferns, cryo-flora | Blue giant star |
| 🌋 **VOLCANIC** | NE (x≥50, y≥50) | Obsidian,ite deposits | Fire blooms, heat-resistant flora | Red dwarf binary |
| 💜 **BIOLUMINESCENT** | SW (x<50, y<50) | Phosphorescent soil | Glowing fungi, luminescent plants | Green pulsar |
| 🦴 **FOSSILIZED** | SE (x≥50, y<50) | Amber deposits, ite minerals | Petrified trees, ancient flora | Yellow sun |

Your job: build AI agents that can analyze the evidence and deduce which biome you're in.

## Set Up Your Environment
Duration: 3 min

### Need Google Cloud Credits?
> • **If you are attending an instructor-led workshop**: Your instructor will provide you with a credit code. Please use the one they provide.  
> • **If you are working through this Codelab on your own**: You can redeem a free Google Cloud credit to cover the workshop costs. Please [click this link](https://goo.gle/way-back-home-credits) to get a credit and follow the steps in the video guide below to apply it to your account.  
>[![Watch the video](img/02-01-redeem-google-cloud-credits.png)](https://youtu.be/dR-NrgMTADs)  
>

### Run the Environment Setup Script

Before generating evidence, you need to enable the required Google Cloud APIs, including [OneMCP](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-official-mcp-support-for-google-services) for BigQuery which provides managed MCP access to BigQuery.

<aside class="positive">
<strong>Architect's Note: OneMCP</strong>  

OneMCP is Google's managed MCP service. Instead of building your own MCP server for BigQuery access, you connect to Google's pre-built server at <code>bigquery.googleapis.com/mcp</code>. This demonstrates the <em>managed MCP pattern</em>—you configure the connection, Google provides the tools.
</aside>

👉💻 Run the environment setup script:

```bash
cd $HOME/way-back-home/level_1
chmod +x setup/setup_env.sh
./setup/setup_env.sh
```

## Generate Crash Site Evidence
Duration: 2 min

Now generate personalized crash site evidence based on your coordinates.

<aside class="positive">
<strong>Architect's Note: AI Content Generation</strong>

This step demonstrates AI-powered content generation. The evidence images and video are created by Gemini, tailored to your specific location on the planet. This same technique is used in production for generating personalized training data, test fixtures, and synthetic content.
</aside>

### Run the Evidence Generator

👉💻 From the `level_1` directory, run:

```bash
cd $HOME/way-back-home/level_1
uv run python generate_evidence.py
```

You should see output like:

```
✓ Welcome back, Explorer_Aria!

### Review Your Evidence

👉 Take a moment to look at your generated evidence files in the `outputs/` folder. Each one reflects the biome characteristics of your crash location—though you won't know which biome until your AI agents analyze them!

Your generated evidence may look something like this depending on your location:

![example flora recording](img/03-01-flora-recording.gif)
<br>
![example soil sample](img/03-02-soil-sample.png)
<br>
![example star field](img/03-03-star-field.png)

## Build the Custom MCP Server
Duration: 8 min

Your escape pod's onboard analysis systems are fried, but the raw sensor data survived the crash. You'll build an MCP server with [FastMCP](https://github.com/jlowin/fastmcp) that provides geological and botanical analysis tools.

<aside class="positive">
<strong>Architect's Note: FastMCP</strong>  

We're building a custom MCP server using FastMCP—a Pythonic framework that handles all MCP protocol details. You just define tools using the <code>@mcp.tool()</code> decorator. The server uses HTTP transport for Cloud Run deployment, exposing the MCP protocol at <code>/mcp</code>.
</aside>

### Create the Geological Analysis Tool

This tool analyzes soil sample images to identify mineral composition.

👉✏️ Open `$HOME/way-back-home/level_1/mcp-server/main.py` and find `#REPLACE-GEOLOGICAL-TOOL`. Replace it with:

```python
GEOLOGICAL_PROMPT = """Analyze this alien soil sample image.

Classify the PRIMARY characteristic (choose exactly one):

1. CRYO - Frozen/icy minerals, crystalline structures, frost patterns,
   blue-white coloration, permafrost indicators

2. VOLCANIC - Volcanic rock, basalt, obsidian, sulfur deposits,
   red-orange minerals, heat-formed crystite structures

3. BIOLUMINESCENT - Glowing particles, phosphorescent minerals,
   organic-mineral hybrids, purple-green luminescence

4. FOSSILIZED - Ancient compressed minerals, amber deposits,
   petrified organic matter, golden-brown stratification

Respond ONLY with valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation):

        return {"error": str(e), "biome": "UNKNOWN", "confidence": 0.0}
```

### Create the Botanical Analysis Tool

This tool analyzes flora video recordings—including the audio track.

👉✏️ In the same file (`$HOME/way-back-home/level_1/mcp-server/main.py`), find `#REPLACE-BOTANICAL-TOOL` and replace it with:

```python
BOTANICAL_PROMPT = """Analyze this alien flora video recording.

Pay attention to BOTH:
1. VISUAL elements: Plant appearance, movement patterns, colors, bioluminescence
2. AUDIO elements: Ambient sounds, rustling, organic noises, frequencies

Classify the PRIMARY biome (choose exactly one):

1. CRYO - Crystalline ice-plants, frost-covered vegetation, 
   crackling/tinkling sounds, slow brittle movements, blue-white flora

2. VOLCANIC - Heat-resistant plants, sulfur-adapted species,
   hissing/bubbling sounds, smoke-filtering vegetation, red-orange flora

3. BIOLUMINESCENT - Glowing plants, pulsing light patterns,
   humming/resonating sounds, reactive to stimuli, purple-green flora

4. FOSSILIZED - Ancient petrified plants, amber-preserved specimens,
   deep resonant sounds, minimal movement, golden-brown flora

Respond ONLY with valid JSON (no markdown, no explanation):

        return {"error": str(e), "biome": "UNKNOWN", "confidence": 0.0}
```

<aside class="positive">
<strong>Note</strong>

With FastMCP, you don't need to manually register tools—the <code>@mcp.tool()</code> decorator handles everything automatically!
</aside>

### Test MCP Server Locally

👉💻 Test the MCP server:

```bash
cd $HOME/way-back-home/level_1/mcp-server
pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py
```

You should see:

```
[INFO] Initialized Gemini client for project: your-project-id
[INFO] 🚀 Location Analyzer MCP Server starting on port 8080
[INFO] 📍 MCP endpoint: http://0.0.0.0:8080/mcp
[INFO] 🔧 Tools: analyze_geological, analyze_botanical
```

![fastmcp server](img/04-01-fastmcp-server.png)

The FastMCP server is now running with HTTP transport. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop.

### Deploy MCP Server to Cloud Run

👉💻 Deploy:

```bash
cd $HOME/way-back-home/level_1/mcp-server
source $HOME/way-back-home/set_env.sh

gcloud builds submit . \
  --config=cloudbuild.yaml \
  --substitutions=_REGION="$REGION",_REPO_NAME="$REPO_NAME",_SERVICE_ACCOUNT="$SERVICE_ACCOUNT"
```

### Save the Service URL

👉💻 Save the service URL:

```bash
export MCP_SERVER_URL=$(gcloud run services describe location-analyzer \
  --region=$REGION --format='value(status.url)')
echo "MCP Server URL: $MCP_SERVER_URL"

# Add to set_env.sh for later use
echo "export MCP_SERVER_URL=\"$MCP_SERVER_URL\"" >> $HOME/way-back-home/set_env.sh
```

## Build the Specialist Agents
Duration: 8 min

Now you'll create three specialist agents, each with a single responsibility.

<aside class="positive">
<strong>Architect's Note: Single Responsibility</strong>

This is the <strong>single responsibility principle</strong> applied to AI agents. Each specialist:
<ul>
<li>Has ONE job</li>
<li>Uses specific tools for that job</li>
<li>Returns a structured result</li>
</ul>

This makes agents easier to test, debug, and replace.
</aside>

### Create the Geological Analyst Agent

👉✏️ Open `agent/agents/geological_analyst.py` and find `#REPLACE-GEOLOGICAL-AGENT`. Replace it with:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from agent.tools.mcp_tools import get_geological_tool

geological_analyst = Agent(
    name="GeologicalAnalyst",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    description="Analyzes soil samples to classify planetary biome based on mineral composition.",
    instruction="""You are a geological specialist analyzing alien soil samples.

## YOUR EVIDENCE TO ANALYZE
Soil sample URL: {soil_url}

## YOUR TASK
1. Call the analyze_geological tool with the soil sample URL above
2. Examine the results for mineral composition and biome indicators
3. Report your findings clearly

The four possible biomes are:
- CRYO: Frozen, icy minerals, blue/white coloring
- VOLCANIC: Magma, obsidian, volcanic rock, red/orange coloring
- BIOLUMINESCENT: Glowing, phosphorescent minerals, purple/green
- FOSSILIZED: Amber, ancient preserved matter, golden/brown

## REPORTING FORMAT
Always report your classification clearly:
"GEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS: [BIOME] (confidence: X%)"

Include a brief description of what you observed in the sample.

## IMPORTANT
- You do NOT synthesize with other evidence
- You do NOT confirm locations
- Just analyze the soil sample and report what you find
- Call the tool immediately with the URL provided above""",
    tools=[get_geological_tool()]
)
```

### Create the Botanical Analyst Agent

👉✏️ Open `agent/agents/botanical_analyst.py` and find `#REPLACE-BOTANICAL-AGENT`. Replace it with:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from agent.tools.mcp_tools import get_botanical_tool

botanical_analyst = Agent(
    name="BotanicalAnalyst",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    description="Analyzes flora recordings to classify planetary biome based on plant life and ambient sounds.",
    instruction="""You are a botanical specialist analyzing alien flora recordings.

## YOUR EVIDENCE TO ANALYZE
Flora recording URL: {flora_url}

## YOUR TASK
1. Call the analyze_botanical tool with the flora recording URL above
2. Pay attention to BOTH visual AND audio elements in the recording
3. Report your findings clearly

The four possible biomes are:
- CRYO: Frost ferns, crystalline plants, cold wind sounds, crackling ice
- VOLCANIC: Fire blooms, heat-resistant flora, crackling/hissing sounds
- BIOLUMINESCENT: Glowing fungi, luminescent plants, ethereal hum, chiming
- FOSSILIZED: Petrified trees, ancient formations, deep resonant sounds

## REPORTING FORMAT
Always report your classification clearly:
"BOTANICAL ANALYSIS: [BIOME] (confidence: X%)"

Include descriptions of what you SAW and what you HEARD.

## IMPORTANT
- You do NOT synthesize with other evidence
- You do NOT confirm locations
- Just analyze the flora recording and report what you find
- Call the tool immediately with the URL provided above""",
    tools=[get_botanical_tool()]
)
```

### Create the Astronomical Analyst Agent

This agent uses a different approach with **two tool patterns**:  

1. **Local FunctionTool**: Gemini Vision to extract star features  
2. **OneMCP BigQuery**: Query the star catalog via Google's managed MCP  

<aside class="positive">
<strong>What is OneMCP?</strong>

[OneMCP](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/ai-machine-learning/announcing-official-mcp-support-for-google-services) is Google's managed MCP service that provides pre-built MCP servers for Google Cloud services. Instead of writing your own BigQuery client code, you connect to Google's hosted server at <code>bigquery.googleapis.com/mcp</code> and get instant access to tools like <code>execute_query</code>. Think of it as "BigQuery-as-a-tool" — no setup required beyond enabling the API.
</aside>

<aside class="positive">
<strong>Architect's Note: Mixed Tool Architectures</strong>

This demonstrates mixing local tools with managed MCP tools. The agent uses <code>extract_star_features</code> (a local FunctionTool) then queries BigQuery via OneMCP's <code>execute_query</code> tool. The <code>{stars_url}</code> and <code>{project_id}</code> placeholders are replaced at runtime from state.
</aside>

👉✏️ Open `agent/agents/astronomical_analyst.py` and find `#REPLACE-ASTRONOMICAL-AGENT`. Replace it with:

```python
from google.adk.agents import Agent
from agent.tools.star_tools import (
    extract_star_features_tool,
    get_bigquery_mcp_toolset,
)

# Get the BigQuery MCP toolset
bigquery_toolset = get_bigquery_mcp_toolset()

astronomical_analyst = Agent(
    name="AstronomicalAnalyst",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    description="Analyzes star field images and queries the star catalog via OneMCP BigQuery.",
    instruction="""You are an astronomical specialist analyzing alien night skies.

## YOUR EVIDENCE TO ANALYZE
Star field URL: {stars_url}

## YOUR TWO TOOLS

### TOOL 1: extract_star_features (Local Gemini Vision)
Call this FIRST with the star field URL above.
Returns: "primary_star": "...", "nebula_type": "...", "stellar_color": "..."

### TOOL 2: BigQuery MCP (execute_query)
Call this SECOND with the results from Tool 1.
Use this exact SQL query (replace the placeholders with values from Step 1):

SELECT quadrant, biome, primary_star, nebula_type
FROM `{project_id}.way_back_home.star_catalog`
WHERE LOWER(primary_star) = LOWER('PRIMARY_STAR_FROM_STEP_1')
  AND LOWER(nebula_type) = LOWER('NEBULA_TYPE_FROM_STEP_1')
LIMIT 1

## YOUR WORKFLOW
1. Call extract_star_features with: {stars_url}
2. Get the primary_star and nebula_type from the result
3. Call execute_query with the SQL above (replacing placeholders)
4. Report the biome and quadrant from the query result

## BIOME REFERENCE
| Biome | Quadrant | Primary Star | Nebula Type |
|-------|----------|--------------|-------------|
| CRYO | NW | blue_giant | ice_blue |
| VOLCANIC | NE | red_dwarf_binary | fire |
| BIOLUMINESCENT | SW | green_pulsar | purple_magenta |
| FOSSILIZED | SE | yellow_sun | golden |

## REPORTING FORMAT
"ASTRONOMICAL ANALYSIS: [BIOME] in [QUADRANT] quadrant (confidence: X%)"

Include a description of the stellar features you observed.

## IMPORTANT
- You do NOT synthesize with other evidence
- You do NOT confirm locations
- Just analyze the stars and report what you find
- Start by calling extract_star_features with the URL above""",
    tools=[extract_star_features_tool, bigquery_toolset]
)
```

## Build the MCP Tool Connections
Duration: 8 min

Now you'll create the Python wrappers that let your ADK agents talk to MCP servers. These wrappers handle the connection lifecycle — establishing sessions, invoking tools, and parsing responses.

### Create MCP Tool Connection (Custom MCP)

This connects to your custom FastMCP server deployed on Cloud Run.

<aside class="positive">
<strong>Architect's Note: Why StreamableHTTPConnectionParams?</strong>

MCP supports multiple transport layers (stdio, SSE, HTTP). Since your MCP server is deployed on Cloud Run as a web service, you need HTTP transport. <code>StreamableHTTPConnectionParams</code> tells ADK to communicate with the MCP server over HTTP — specifically by connecting to the <code>/mcp</code> endpoint that FastMCP exposes automatically. This is the standard transport for cloud-deployed MCP servers.
</aside>

👉✏️ Open `agent/tools/mcp_tools.py` and find `#REPLACE-MCP-TOOL-CONNECTION`. Replace it with:

```python
import os
import logging

from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_toolset import MCPToolset
from google.adk.tools.mcp_tool.mcp_session_manager import StreamableHTTPConnectionParams

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

MCP_SERVER_URL = os.environ.get("MCP_SERVER_URL")

_mcp_toolset = None

def get_mcp_toolset():
    """Get the MCPToolset connected to the location-analyzer server."""
    global _mcp_toolset
    
    if _mcp_toolset is not None:
        return _mcp_toolset
    
    if not MCP_SERVER_URL:
        raise ValueError(
            "MCP_SERVER_URL not set. Please run:\n"
            "  export MCP_SERVER_URL='https://location-analyzer-xxx.a.run.app'"
        )
    
    # FastMCP exposes MCP protocol at /mcp endpoint
    mcp_endpoint = f"{MCP_SERVER_URL}/mcp"
    logger.info(f"[MCP Tools] Connecting to: {mcp_endpoint}")
    
    _mcp_toolset = MCPToolset(
        connection_params=StreamableHTTPConnectionParams(
            url=mcp_endpoint,
            timeout=120,  # 2 minutes for Gemini analysis
        )
    )
    
    return _mcp_toolset

def get_geological_tool():
    """Get the geological analysis tool from the MCP server."""
    return get_mcp_toolset()

def get_botanical_tool():
    """Get the botanical analysis tool from the MCP server."""
    return get_mcp_toolset()
```

### Create Star Analysis Tools (OneMCP BigQuery)

The star catalog you loaded earlier into BigQuery contains stellar patterns for each biome. Instead of writing BigQuery client code to query it, we connect to Google's OneMCP BigQuery server — which exposes BigQuery's `execute_query` capability as an MCP tool that any ADK agent can use directly.

<aside class="positive">
<strong>Architect's Note: Two MCP Patterns, Same Connection Style</strong>

Notice the difference:

## Build the Orchestrator
Duration: 8 min

Now create the parallel crew and root orchestrator that coordinates everything.

### Create the Parallel Analysis Crew

Why run the three specialists in parallel? Because they are **completely independent** — the geological analyst doesn't need to wait for the botanical analyst's results, and vice versa. Each specialist analyzes a different piece of evidence using different tools. A `ParallelAgent` runs all three concurrently, reducing total analysis time from ~30s (sequential) to ~10s (parallel).

<aside class="positive">
<strong>What is before_agent_callback?</strong>

In ADK, a <code>before_agent_callback</code> is a function that runs **before** the agent starts processing any user request. Think of it as a setup hook — the agent's "preparation step."

Here's why it matters for this architecture:
<ol>
<li>It runs ONCE when the agent starts processing a request</li>
<li>It fetches participant data from the backend API using <code>PARTICIPANT_ID</code></li>
<li>It populates the agent's <strong>state</strong> with values like <code>soil_url</code>, <code>flora_url</code>, <code>stars_url</code></li>
<li>All sub-agents automatically access these values via <code>{key}</code> templating in their instructions</li>
</ol>

Without this callback, each sub-agent would need to know how to fetch configuration on its own. The callback centralizes this once, and state sharing distributes it everywhere.

This means:
<ul>
<li>No config file reading in sub-agents</li>
<li>No imports of config utilities</li>
<li>Same code works locally AND deployed to Cloud Run</li>
<li>ONE API call instead of multiple</li>
</ul>

```

### Create the Root Orchestrator

Now create the root agent that coordinates everything and uses the callback.

👉✏️ In the same file (`agent/agent.py`), find `#REPLACE-ROOT-ORCHESTRATOR`. Replace it with:

```python
root_agent = Agent(
    name="MissionAnalysisAI",
    model="gemini-2.5-flash",
    description="Coordinates crash site analysis to confirm explorer location.",
    instruction="""You are the Mission Analysis AI coordinating a rescue operation.

## Explorer Information
- Name: {username}
- Coordinates: ({x}, {y})

## Evidence URLs (automatically provided to specialists via state)
- Soil sample: {soil_url}
- Flora recording: {flora_url}
- Star field: {stars_url}

## Your Workflow

### STEP 1: DELEGATE TO ANALYSIS CREW
Tell the EvidenceAnalysisCrew to analyze all the evidence.
The evidence URLs are already available to the specialists.

### STEP 2: COLLECT RESULTS
Each specialist will report:
- "GEOLOGICAL ANALYSIS: [BIOME] (confidence: X%)"
- "BOTANICAL ANALYSIS: [BIOME] (confidence: X%)"
- "ASTRONOMICAL ANALYSIS: [BIOME] in [QUADRANT] quadrant (confidence: X%)"

### STEP 3: APPLY 2-OF-3 AGREEMENT RULE
- If 2 or 3 specialists agree → that's the answer
- If all 3 disagree → use judgment based on confidence

### STEP 4: CONFIRM LOCATION
Call confirm_location with the determined biome.

## Biome Reference
| Biome | Quadrant | Key Characteristics |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| CRYO | NW | Frozen, blue, ice crystals |
| VOLCANIC | NE | Magma, red/orange, obsidian |
| BIOLUMINESCENT | SW | Glowing, purple/green |
| FOSSILIZED | SE | Amber, golden, ancient |

## Response Style
Be encouraging and narrative! Celebrate when the beacon activates!
""",
    sub_agents=[evidence_analysis_crew],
    tools=[confirm_location_tool],
    before_agent_callback=setup_participant_context
)
```

### Create the Location Confirmation Tool

This is the final piece — the tool that actually **confirms your location** to Mission Control and activates your beacon. When the root orchestrator determines which biome you're in (using the 2-of-3 agreement rule), it calls this tool to send the result to the backend API.

This tool uses `ToolContext`, which gives it access to the state values (like `participant_id` and `backend_url`) that were set by the `before_agent_callback` earlier.

<aside class="positive">
<strong>Architect's Note: ToolContext for State Access</strong>

Tools can access state via <code>ToolContext</code>:
<pre>
def my_tool(arg: str, tool_context: ToolContext) -> dict:
    value = tool_context.state.get("key")
</pre>

This is how <code>confirm_location</code> gets the participant_id, coordinates, and backend_url that were set by the callback.

## Deploy to Cloud Run
Duration: 5 min

Now deploy your multi-agent system to Cloud Run for [A2A](https://github.com/a2aproject/A2A) readiness.

![a2a agent discovery](img/09-01-a2a-agent-discovery.png)

<aside class="positive">
<strong>Architect's Note: ADK Deployment</strong>

The <code>adk deploy cloud_run</code> command handles all deployment complexity:
<ul>
<li>Builds a container with your agent code</li>
<li>Deploys to Cloud Run with proper configuration</li>
<li>Sets up the A2A-compatible endpoint automatically</li>
</ul>
</aside>

### Deploy the Agent

👉💻 Deploy to Cloud Run using the ADK CLI:

```bash
cd $HOME/way-back-home/level_1
source $HOME/way-back-home/set_env.sh

adk deploy cloud_run \
  --project=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT \
  --region=$REGION \
  --service_name=mission-analysis-ai \
  --with_ui \
  --a2a \
  ./agent
```

When prompted `Do you want to continue (Y/n)` and `Allow unauthenticated invocations to [mission-analysis-ai] (Y/n)?`, enter `Y` for both to deploy and allow public access to your A2A agent.

You should see output like:

```
Building and deploying agent to Cloud Run...
✓ Container built successfully
✓ Deploying to Cloud Run...
✓ Service deployed: https://mission-analysis-ai-abc123-uc.a.run.app
```

### Set Environment Variables on Cloud Run

The deployed agent needs access to environment variables. Update the service:

👉💻 Set the required environment variables:

```bash
gcloud run services update mission-analysis-ai \
  --region=$REGION \
  --set-env-vars="GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=$GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT,GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION=$REGION,MCP_SERVER_URL=$MCP_SERVER_URL,BACKEND_URL=$BACKEND_URL,PARTICIPANT_ID=$PARTICIPANT_ID,GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=True"
```

### Save the Agent URL

👉💻 Get the deployed URL:

```bash
export AGENT_URL=$(gcloud run services describe mission-analysis-ai \
  --region=$REGION --format='value(status.url)')
echo "Agent URL: $AGENT_URL"

# Add to set_env.sh
echo "export LEVEL1_AGENT_URL=\"$AGENT_URL\"" >> $HOME/way-back-home/set_env.sh
```

### Verify Deployment

👉💻 Test the deployed agent by opening the URL in your browser (the `--with_ui` flag deployed the ADK web interface), or test via curl:

```bash
curl -X GET "$AGENT_URL/list-apps"
```

You should see a response listing your agent.

## Conclusion

### 🎉 Level 1 Complete!

Your rescue beacon is now broadcasting at full strength. The triangulated signal cuts through the atmospheric interference, a steady pulse that says *"I'm here. I survived. Come find me."*

But you're not the only one on this planet. As your beacon activates, you notice other lights flickering to life across the horizon—other survivors, other crash sites, other explorers who made it through.

In **Level 2**, you'll learn to process incoming SOS signals and coordinate with other survivors. The rescue isn't just about being found—it's about finding each other.

### Troubleshooting

**"MCP_SERVER_URL not set"**
```bash
export MCP_SERVER_URL=$(gcloud run services describe location-analyzer \
  --region=$REGION --format='value(status.url)')
```

**"PARTICIPANT_ID not set"**
```bash
source $HOME/way-back-home/set_env.sh
echo $PARTICIPANT_ID
```

**"BigQuery table not found"**
```bash
uv run python setup/setup_star_catalog.py
```

**"Specialists asking for URLs"**
This means `{key}` templating isn't working. Check:
- Is `before_agent_callback` set on the root agent?
- Is the callback setting state values correctly?
- Are sub-agents using `{soil_url}` (not f-strings)?

**"All three analyses disagree"**
Regenerate evidence: `uv run python generate_evidence.py`

**"Agent not responding in adk web"**
- Check that port 8000 is correct
- Verify MCP_SERVER_URL and PARTICIPANT_ID are set
- Check terminal for error messages

### For Non-Gamers: Real-World Applications

"Pinpointing your location" represents **Parallel Expert Analysis with Consensus**—running multiple specialized AI analyses concurrently and synthesizing results.

#### Enterprise Applications

| Use Case | Parallel Experts | Synthesis Rule |
|----------|------------------|----------------|
| **Medical Diagnosis** | Image analyst, symptom analyst, lab analyst | 2-of-3 confidence threshold |
| **Fraud Detection** | Transaction analyst, behavior analyst, network analyst | Any 1 flags = review |
| **Document Processing** | OCR agent, classification agent, extraction agent | All must agree |
| **Quality Control** | Visual inspector, sensor analyst, spec checker | 2-of-3 pass |

#### Key Architectural Insights

1. **before_agent_callback for configuration**: Fetch config once at the start, populate state for all sub-agents. No config file reading in sub-agents.

2. **{key} State Templating**: Declarative, clean, idiomatic. No f-strings, no imports, no sys.path manipulation.

3. **Consensus mechanisms**: 2-of-3 agreement handles ambiguity robustly without requiring unanimous agreement.

4. **ParallelAgent for independent tasks**: When analyses don't depend on each other, run them concurrently for speed.

5. **Two MCP patterns**: Custom (build your own) vs. OneMCP (Google-hosted). Both use StreamableHTTP.

6. **Stateless deployment**: Same code works locally and deployed. Environment variables + backend API = no config files in containers.
